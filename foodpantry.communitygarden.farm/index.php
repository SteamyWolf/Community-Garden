				<p>
					"We sustain our organization by the donated services & goods offered by the community. We have many civic services that we provide to our communities including; fruit picking, gardeners' markets, and free classes/workshops. We seek to work closely with ALL cities and organization to create similar groups within their communities. We love giving ideas and support to such groups, wherever they may be."

				<div class="heading">Why "Earth Community Food Pantry"?</div>
				<p>
					Why do we operate a pantry?
				</p>
				<p>
					Ideally, we would all be growing and consuming fresh, locally sourced food. However, we realize that hunger most often cannot wait the several months it takes to plant and grow your own food. There are also millions of pounds of food and grocery store waste being put into the landfills each day! So we help distribute this food to prevent it from becoming more human waste for the Earth. This food waste is both an environmental concern and a humanitarian concern that will ultimately effect the gardens we wish to grow.

								Earth Community Garden is a 501c3 nonprofit organization formerly known as Holladay Community Garden.

We manage, sponsor and invest in gardens than look to bring about community building, peace and justice through sound methods of tending to gardens. Each garden that we develop, promote or fund is unique in regards to how the garden operates with the populations they serve. For specific information on a particular garden, feel free to contact us. HAPPY GARDENING!

								Part of Our Mission is to "educate the public." This includes the active teaching of food sources to those who have the ability to make positive changes in environmental practices. We strive to empower minds to continually seek out innovative methods of quality nutritional assistance that improve the whole Earth. We try to teach sound distribution principles because one never knows who will be that "one" to revolutionize a way to bring food to all those in need on this Earth's "community garden." 
<br>ALL CLASSES WE HOLD ARE FREE!
