										As the earth's population increases, we need to be more conscious on how we use and conserve water. Any ideas? Let's implement them. Earth Community Garden tries to use the most water conscious methods, but there is always room for improvement.

				<p>
					"We sustain our organization by the donated services & goods offered by the community. We have many civic services that we provide to our communities including; fruit picking, gardeners' markets, and free classes/workshops. We seek to work closely with ALL cities and organization to create similar groups within their communities. We love giving ideas and support to such groups, wherever they may be."

				<div class="heading">Why "Earth Community Garden"?</div>
				<p>
					What's in a name?
				</p>
				<p>
					We started off as the "Holladay Community Garden" because all three gardens were located in the City of Holladay (Casto Home Gardens, Patch Garden Project, Farmers Market Garden). When we "branched" out of Holladay, the original name did not seem as inclusive. So we thought about calling us "Utah Community Gardens" but we figured why stop there? "Earth" seemed to encompass it all! But now with water possibly being discovered on Mars, who knows . . . So now we are Earth Community GARDEN, not GardenS, because we all live in one big garden. The word "gardens" seems to divide rather than unite. Each of us live on this big garden called Earth and we must all do our part to make sure our portion of the garden is cared for and tended. Whether it is; your own yard, the area outside your apartment, your business or the future site of one of these, we should all feel the need to beautify our surroundings in a responsible and sustainable way.
