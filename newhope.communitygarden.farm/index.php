								We want to help you start a community garden in your neighborhood! We also want to help you manage an existing community garden, and move beyond sustainability into regeneration. Part of Our Mission is to "Educate the public..." This includes the active teaching of those who have the ability to make positive changes in environmental practices. We strive to empower minds to continually seek out innovative methods that improve the Earth's systems. We try to teach basic foundations and sound gardening principles, because one never knows who will be the next to revolutionize Earth's "community garden."
